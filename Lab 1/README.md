# Staging Interaction

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.

For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. 

_Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_



## Prep

### To start the semester, you will need:
1. Set up your own Github "Lab Hub" repository to keep all you work in record by [following these instructions](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Fall/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md).
2. Set up the README.md for your Hub repository (for instance, so that it has your name and points to your own Lab 1) and [learn how to](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) organize and post links to your submissions on your README.md so we can find them easily.
3. (extra: Learn about what exactly Git is from [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F).)

### For this lab, you will need:
1. Paper
2. Markers/ Pens
3. Scissors
4. Smart Phone -- The main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
5. Computer -- We will use your computer to host a webpage which also features controls.
6. Found objects and materials -- You will have to costume your phone so that it looks like some other devices. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case, etc. Be creative!

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. Storyboard
1. Sketches/photos of costumed device
1. Any reflections you have on the process
1. Video sketch of the prototyped interaction
1. Submit the items above in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same from each person in the group.

### The Report
This README.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done (the deliverables mentioned above). Following the format below, you can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in your README.md for the lab.

## Part A. Plan 

\*\***Background**\*\*

The home is a major hub of daily activity for individuals and families across various age groups, from children to elderly adults. This became increasingly important during the pandemic of 2020 as we all shifted a significant part of our “outside the home” activities from schooling to office work to the home, with an array of makeshift solutions to adjust.  During this pandemic, mental health also became increasingly important from feelings of isolation to specific weaknesses in our current social models in how we check up on the elderly who became even more vulnerable during this time.

With all of this in mind, the psychological health and wellbeing of people became even more pressing and saw responses like significant interest in more solutions or apps that cater to this. These apps often require subscriptions to support the regular spoken content they provide but what if we could find a simpler more elementary solution within the home? What about using light as a healing vehicle within the home to adjust the mood of the individual to a healthier state?

\*\***Sceanrio**\*\*

To simplify this, we will assume a scenario such as an elderly adult, living alone during the pandemic. Our interactive device “**Luminar**” will help adjust the mood of a person back to a positive state to boost their mental health and wellbeing. We will use one input channel to detect current mood (voice) and use light therapy to respond back with the goal of altering their current mood state back to a positive or neutral outcome. We will focus on correcting two potential moods often felt by elderly adults within the negative spectrum. The first being depression (low arousal) which can be corrected using activating light (orange and red tonal colours).  The second being unrest (high arousal) which can be corrected with a combination of blue light and cyan accented tones. We also acknowledge a neutral positive state to be of a general warm yellow amber lighting. You can read more about the research into colour therapy for mood correction within this study done in conjunction with Philips [here](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/276973904_Design_Considerations_for_Adaptive_Lighting_to_Improve_Seniors'_Mood). Please note I will contunie to spell in British style :-)

**Storyboard**

**Feedback from Presentation**

Thought it was a great idea, wondered what lights work for when the elder is in a neutral mood if there was anyway to enhance that further. This will require further research, as one woudl have to discern the type of neutral mood and develop a model as to how to enhace it further. Also pointed out that this did not need to be limited to elders as children could also experience feelings of depression and unrest but perhaps exhibit it more eailsy in facial expressions. Valid points as my research did demostrate a combination of facial recognition (would require computer vision work) and voice recognition is trypically used to discern current mood state in paticipant. The scope of this however can be considered for a longererm project.



## Part B. Act out the Interaction

What is intersting about the idea is you actually needs it to illuminate the room to get the desired effect fully. I tried to turn off other lighting in the room to make it more obvious a particular colour was being eminated from the phone in order to make the science of mood lighting work better. This enhanced the expereince and effect.  So perhaps the light needs to not only be powerful enough and well distributed to illuminate the room fully, but also take a central position within it.


## Part C. Prototype the device

**Feedback on Tinkerbelle**

For my interactive device, it is really important to be able to get a tonal colour effect. I appreciated the gradient  colour efefct I could achieve from the colour palette as it worked well with the science of mood lighting to affect state. I also see value in teh audio as light and sound are simple effective ways of altering mood. This could be a very useful way to extend the usefulness of the device. 

It would be good to solve for the iPhone contraints however they did not prove to be a significant issue in conducting the experiment i.e. cannot go to full screen on Tinkerbell iPhone side.



## Part D. Wizard the device
 

**Setup Test**

An initial setup to understand the lighting states desired for negative mood lifting can be found here:

**Follow-up Test Run**

In the follow up I was able to model the two possibilities as two seperate interactions. That is, the participant arrives as a depressed state and requires activiating red-amber like lighting, followed by a state of unrest that requires a calming ble-cyan like lighting. These are modelled with objects of similar colours as well as voice recognition by story cards. This interaction can be viewed here:

[![Followup Unrest Lift video Luminar]({FollowupShot1.jpg})]({IMG_3571.MOV} "Link Title")

## Part E. Costume the device

One of my core considerations in designign th device is it needed to be able to distribute the light well through the room. I thought something spherical or globe like would work well, mimicing a light bulb look in the room but adaptive enough it could easilybe placed on a mantle with its own base to stand. 

It also needs to be transparent/translucent so the light can flow through well enough to give the desired effect.

Another angle I thought about explroing was, because the goal of the device is to return the paticipant to a stable positive state was to put a smiley face on it. I decided against this design because i thoguh tI would be limiting its use, I also thought it make come across "scary looking" to always permanently be smiling if the particiapnt was in a foul mood. It was more important that the "ligt do the talking" and comunicate the mood based on participant state. 

Finally, I considered the idea it may be useful for touch activation to turn this on and off. This could be good from a mobility perspective for night time but it has to not turn off the entire system, should I later implement this function.

Here is a sketch of what I thought the device may look like:

![Luminar Design Options](LuminarDesignOptions.jpg)

I decided to find a concave like globe device that had enough transparency to eminate light successfully. I wanted to keep the design simple, I think it is important it doesnot look like something out of place but also can be a design asthetic choice of lighting when styling a room.

# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative!
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*
